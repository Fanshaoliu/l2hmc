# L2HMC: Automatic Training of MCMC Samplers

TensorFlow open source implementation for training MCMC samplers from the paper:

*Generalizing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Neural Network* [link](http://link)

Given an analytically described distributions (implemented as in `utils/distributions.py`), L2HMC enables training of fast-mixing samplers. We provide an example, in the case of the Strongly-Correlated Gaussian, in the notebook `SCGExperiment.ipynb` --other details are included in the paper.
